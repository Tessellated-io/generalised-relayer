# Generalised Relayer

The Generalised Relayer is built to act as a relayer for different AMBs using the [Generalised Incentives](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedIncentives) scheme. 

The goal for the Generalised Relayer is 2 fold:

1. Acts as a reference implementation of a relayer that understands [Generalised Incentives](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedIncentives).
2. Lower the barrier to entry resulting in greater competition which will improve relaying speed, robustness, and resistance to censorship.

Currently, the Relayer supports the following AMBs:

- Wormhole

And act as a relayer for signed messages (called mock).

# Running the relayer

It is advised to run the relayer via docker. In which case the dependencies are:

- Docker
- Docker Compose plugin.

With these dependencies the relayer can be started by running

```bash
docker compose up (-d)
```
Adding `-d` runs the relayer in the background rather than foreground.

Starting the relayer without configuration does not make sense. See [configuration](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedRelayer/tree/main#configuration) for further information.

# Development

For development, the requiresments vary by AMB. For the specific requirements, see the docker compose file.

Regardless, a redis instance is needed. The simplest way to get one is through docker with:
```bash
docker container run -p 6379:6379 redis
```

Afterwards the dependencies can be installed and the relayer can be build:

```bash
yarn install && yarn build
```

The relayer can then be started by running

```bash
yarn start
```


## Configuration

To run the relayer, it is mandatory to provide a config file and an relevant environment variables. Start by making a copy of `.env.example`
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Set `COMPOSE_PROFILES` as a comma seperates list of the AMBs you want to relay for. If it is AMB_X and AMB_Y then set it as: `"amb_x,amb_y"`. Soon we will also set these ambs in the config. You should also set `NODE_ENV` which you can find more information about in the [node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/nodejs-the-difference-between-development-and-production). We recommend setting it to `production`:
```bash
echo NODE_ENV=production >> .env
```

A config reference is provided as `config.example.yaml`. Make a copy:
```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.<NODE_ENV>.yaml
```
where `<NODE_ENV>` is the value you set `NODE_ENV` to.

The field `relayer.privateKey` needs to be set with a funded privatekey for all chains the relayer should run on. You should also update the amb to include all AMBs you specificed in `COMPOSE_PROFILES`.

Supported chains can be configured under `chains`. The current example rpcs are public and hopefully good enough to run the relayer for a short period. For production environment we recommend using paid rpcs.

# Relayer Structure

The Relayer is devided into 4 main services: `Getter`, `Evaluator`, `Collector`, and `Submitter`. These services work together to get all bounties, evaluate their value, collect message proofs, and submit them on chain. The services communicate using `redis` and are run in parallel. Wherever it makes sense, chains are allocated seperate workers to ensure a chain fault doesn't propagate and impact the performance on other chains.

## Getter

The Getter service is responsible for fetching on-chain bounties and messages. It works by searching for relevant EVM logs:

These events are:

- `BountyPlaced`: Signals that a message has been initiated and also contains the associated incentives.
- `MessageDelivered`: Signals that a message has been relayed from source to destination.
- `BountyClaimed`: Signals that a message has been relayed from destination to source, and the bounty has been distributed.
- `BountyIncreased`: Singals that the associated relaying incentive has been updated.

It holds the map of currently tracked bounties, all pending bounties are sent to the evaluator to gauge their profitability.

## Evaluator

The evaluator takes in messages along with their parameters to estimate if it is worth it to relay the message. It exposes a method which is called on the submittor for evaluations.

## Collector

The collector service is collecting information from various AMB's to pair with the bounty given from the `Getter` before calling the submitter for the final step.

## Submitter

The submitter service gets the information gathered by all the services, simulates the transaction for gas usage and compares it to the evaluatorâ€™s conditions.
If it is profitable the submitter will relay the message using the [processPacket](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedRelayer/blob/32cc0c56d1891f03257971723ce9ba9d15b900af/abis/IncentivizedMockEscrow.json#L735-L757) method from the IncentivizedMessageEscrow contract.

# Adding a new AMB

In order to add a new AMB you need to create a new service folder under [collector](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedRelayer/blob/main/src/collector) and make an independent service that can be run on it's own worker thread. For each chain, a worker will be spawned with the appropiate context. For more documentation, read the documentation for the bootstrap function of mock.

Inside the service after you recieve the amb information use `redis.postMessage(emitToChannel, ambPayload)` to deliver it to the submitter.

To ensure the AMB is being created, add it to the both the use config but also `config.example.yaml`.


# Using the Mock implementation

The mock implementation is PoA scheme which works well for testnet, development, or testing. To use it, deploy a [Mock Generalised Incentive](https://github.com/catalystdao/GeneralisedIncentives/tree/main/src/apps/mock) implementation using a known key. Then set the key in the config and run the relayer.
